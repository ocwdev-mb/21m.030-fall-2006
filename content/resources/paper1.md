description: A two-part research project. The first essay asks you to define a chosen
  musical culture in terms of geography, history, and ethnic boundaries. What, where,
  and who plays what kind of a musical repertoire? In ethnomusicological terminology,
  this is a normative description. The second essay will be about your excursion ?into
  the field? and will concentrate on the particular description of the music and its
  context. There must be a living component to these papers?researching just recordings
  and books will not be sufficient.
